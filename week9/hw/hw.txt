It's still safe. Because the other teams don't have the private keys, they
could only see the encrypted bytes. They don't know how to decrypt them.

If other teams had also tapped your keyboards and had observed all of your
team's keystrokes, they would have known the password and username. However,
they still don't have the private key. They can't detect the private key
just through the access to the keyboard.So the network is still safe.

If other teams had physical control of the USB, they have the access to
the private key. Then they can decrypt the communicatons they want. The
network is not safe anymore.

2."gpg --verify" only checks that the target file and the detached signature
match or not. It does not check who creates the file. The hacker can modify
the data align with the change in the digital signature. The results still match.
  A possbile improvement is that a third party can come in with a file
of digital signatures. Then it can verify the signatures through comparison
and confirm who created the file.
