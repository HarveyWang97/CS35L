1. Open Ubuntu terminal and check the setup:
dpkg --get=selections | grep openssh

There is no output so I had to install them.

To install the OpenSSH, I use the command:
   sudo apt-get install openssh-server
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install openssh-client
   sudo apt-get update


2.Server steps:
Generate public and private keys
Command:  ssh-keygen

Generate an account
Command:  sudo useradd -d /home/username -m chengyu
	  sudo passwd chengyu
The output required me to enter the password.
Then I enter the password and confirm it.

Create .ssh directory for new user
Command:  cd /home/username
	  sudo mkdir .ssh

Change ownership and permission on the .ssh directory:
Command:  sudo chown -R chengyu .ssh
          sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Disable password-based authentication:

Command:  sudo chmod 777 /etc/ssh/sshd_confif
          nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Then I manually change the password authentication option to no.

I get my IP address using the command:ifconfig
My address is 10.97.85.92


3. Client steps:
Generate public and private keys:
Command:  ssh-keygen

Copy the public key to the server for key-based authentication:
Command:  ssh-copy-id -i chengyu@10.97.85.92

Add private key to authentication agent(ssh-agent)
Command:  ssh-add

SSH to server
Command:  ssh -X chengyu@10.97.85.92 (With X11 forwarding)

My partner is Qingyi Zhao. I use the command: firefox
on the remote host see whether it opens firefox on my computer.
It works.
