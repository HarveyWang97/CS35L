1. I use man -k to print all the commands that have
 a specific word in their man page. 
I use man man to find it. 

2. cp is located in /bin/cp and wc is located in /usr/bin/wc. 
I use the command which to find their locations. 

3. There are three executable programs that
 have names that are just one character long.  
I use the command find /usr/bin -name ? -executable to find them. 
X: a portable, network-transparent window system. 
w: Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
[ : A bash builtin. 
I use the command man X, man w, man [[] to find what they do. 

4. /etc/alternatives/emacs is actually executed. 
  I use the command readlink /usr/bin/emacs to find it. 

5.g+s means adding the permission to set user or group ID
 on execution of other users who are members of the file's group.
  o-x means removing the execute permission of other users
 not in the file’s group. 
  I use the command man chmod to find the information. 

6. command : find -mtime -21. 
  I use man find to find get the answer.

7.
I use the command find -type d -mtime -21 to find them.

Those are directories that have been modified in the last three weeks. 


8. First, I use the command which find so I know that
 the location of find command is /bin/find. 
Then I use the command find /bin -type l to
 find the symbolic links in the same directory as the find command. 
There are 20.(lnxsrv04) 

9. I first use the command cd /usr/lib.
 Then I use the command ls -alt. The oldest file is libICE.so.6.3.0 

10. Locale command gets data from environmental variables including
 LC_CTYPE, LC_COLLATE,  LC_TIME, LC_NUMERIC, LC_MONETARY and LC_MESSAGES. 
      I learn it through the command man locale

11. Buffer-menu-sort, Buffer-menu-sort-by-column,
 ibuffer-invert-sorting, ibuffer-toggle-sorting-mode. 
      I use C-h a sort to find them. 

12.    C-M-a runs the command beginning-of-defun. 
       Move backward to the beginning of a defun.    
       
       C-M-b runs the command backward-sexp. 
       Move backward across one balanced expression.
       
       C-M-c runs the command exit-recursive-edit. 
       Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.  
       
       C-M-d runs the command down-list.
       Move forward down one level of parentheses. 
       
       C-M-e runs the command end-of-defun. 
       Move forward to next end of defun.
       
       C-M-f runs the command forward-sexp.
       Move forward across one balanced expression.
      
       C-M-g does not exist. 
      
       C-M-h runs the command mark-defun.
       Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.	
    I learn them through the command C-h k keystroke-I-typed-in. 

13. “C-g runs the command keyboard-quit, which is an interactive compiled
Lisp function. It is bound to C-g. (keyboard-quit). Signal a `quit' condition. 
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.” 
To be simple, it quits the current command. 
I use the command C-h k C-g to find the information. 

14. The yank function reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the stretch of
 killed text most recently killed OR yanked. 
I use the command C-h f yank to find it. 

15. The difference between ls -l and the dired function 
in emacs is that the dired function will 
list all the files including
 the hidden files that start their name with “.” 
The command ls -l will not list hidden files. 
Other than that, they give the same output. 
I find it out by comparing their outputs.
